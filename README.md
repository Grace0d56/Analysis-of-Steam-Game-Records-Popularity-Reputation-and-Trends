# Analysis-of-Steam-Game-Records-Popularity-Reputation-and-Trends
A data analysis project from Fall 2024 BA775 (Business Analytics Toolbox), where we used SQL and Tableau to query and visualize video game data on Steam (a digital game distribution platform) to study the trends and patterns in the gaming industry. Our study included analyzing genres, publishers and developers, and price ranges. We also used several metrics like concurrent players, average playtime, number of sales, etc., to define game popularity and compared the most popular titles with the rest to identify what makes them commercially successful. We also created two dashboards in Tableau to visualize comparisons and trends.

Under the leadership of Lifu Li, together with Bei Su, Chenhui Shen, Wenxin Liang, and myself, we finished and presented our findings as the culmination of our class as well as a showcase of our skill set.
